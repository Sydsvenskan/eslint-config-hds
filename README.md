## Installation

Be sure to install versions of peer dependencies that are valid according to the peer dependency specification of this module.

As ESLint configs and dependencies can and will change their rules with major releases you will likely get an incorrect ruleset otherwise.

To easily install all correct peer dependencies, you can use [`install-peerdeps`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/install-peerdeps):

```bash
install-peerdeps @hdsydsvenskan/eslint-config-hds
```
